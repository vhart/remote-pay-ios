# remote-pay-ios

A Swift 2.3 implementation of the CloverConnector to enable iOS and MacOS to communicate with a tethered Clover Mini.

## Version 1.4
NOTE: Full support of version 1.4 features requires remote-pay version 138 or higher.

NOTE: To use the Swift 2.3 compatible version of this library, you will need to point your Podfile at the 1.4.0-swift2.3 branch as listed below in the code sample.

- New Print API
    - please migrate all print requests to the new API utilizing the PrintRequest object:
        - `print(request: PrintRequest)`
    - printing via type-specific functions is deprecated and will be removed in a future release:
        - `printText(lines: [String])`
        - `printImage(image: UIImage)`
        - `printImageFromURL(image: String)`
- New API to open cash drawers
    - please migrate all cash drawer requests to the new API utilizing the OpenCashDrawerRequest object:
        - `openCashDrawer(request: OpenCashDrawerRequest)`
    - opening of cash drawers with a reason string is deprecated and will be removed in a future release:
        - `openCashDrawer(reason: String)`
- Query available printers
    - `retrievePrinters(request: RetrievePrintersRequest)`
    - `onRetrievePrintersResponse(retrievePrintersResponse: RetrievePrintersResponse)`
- Query the status of a print job
    - `retrievePrintJobStatus(request: PrintJobStatusRequest)`
    - `onPrintJobStatusResponse(printJobStatusResponse: PrintJobStatusResponse)`
- Added support for large image printing utilizing message fragmenting
- Creation of an instance of the CloverConnector should now go through the `CloverConnectorFactory` (see example below)
- Support MacOS based apps

## Version 1.3.1
- additional onDeviceError callback for connection errors
- Fixed a few memory leaks with respect to WebSocket connections and Swift String interpolation
- Device status queries to determine that state of the device and payments processed by the device
- retrievePayment/onRetrievePaymentResponse - query and receive the status of a payment on the device by its external id
- retrieveDeviceStatus/onRetrieveDeviceStatusResponse - query and receive the status of the device
- resetDevice now calls back to onResetDeviceResponse with the current status
- Custom activity support for the Mini
- startCustomActivity/onCustomActivityResponse - start a custom activity on the Clover device and receive a callback when it is done
- sendMessageToActivity/onMessageFromActivity - send and receive messages to a custom activity running on the Clover device

### Dependencies
- ObjectMapper - provides JSON serialization/deserialization
- SwiftyJSON - provides simple JSON parsing
- Starscream - provides websocket client capabilities

## Building the example app
- download and install xcode 8.2.1 or 7.3.1 (swift 2.3 support)
- install cocoapods
    - run `sudo gem install cocoapods`
- clone/download the CloverConnector repo
- `cd remote-pay-ios/Example`
- run `pod install`
- should create a Pods directory populated with the Pods specified in the podspec
- should create a workspace file that includes the project, plus a pods project
- run `pod install` a second time
- should update the Pods directory with the installed Pods' dependencies
- open the CloverConnector.xcworkspace file
- change the Bundle identifier for the CloverConnector > CloverConnector_Example target
- change the signing Team for the CloverConnector > CloverConnector_Example target

## Using CloverConnector in your project
- Update your Podspec to include the 1.1.4-Clover branch of Starscream, 1.4 branch of CloverConnector, and the Swift 2.3 post_install script
- pod 'Starscream', :git => 'https://github.com/detour1234/Starscream.git', :branch => '1.1.4-Clover'
- pod 'CloverConnector', :git => 'https://github.com/clover/remote-pay-ios.git', :branch => '1.4.0-swift2.3'
- Add the post_install script (see example) to set the Swift version of the pods to 2.3
- Set the 'Use Legacy Swift Language Version' flag in the build settings for your project
- Example cocoapod (http://cocoapods.org/) `Podfile` snippet

```ruby
platform :ios, '8.0'

target 'RegisterApp' do
  # The queuePriority-1.1.4 branch of our fork of the Starscream framework is required for reliable transport of large files
  # Defining it here in the PodFile overrides the podspec dependency, which isn't allowed to specify a specific location and branch
  pod 'Starscream', :git => 'https://github.com/clover/Starscream.git', :branch => 'queuePriority-1.1.4'

  pod 'CloverConnector', :path => '../'
end

post_install do |installer|
    installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
        target.build_configurations.each do |config|
            config.build_settings['SWIFT_VERSION'] = '2.3'
        end
    end

Sample code using CloverConnector

```swift
import CloverConnector

class ConnectionManager : DefaultCloverConnectorListener, PairingDeviceConfiguration {
var cc:ICloverConnector?

func connect() {
    // load from previous pairing, or nil will force/require
    // a new pairing with the device
    let savedAuthToken = loadAuthToken()

    let config = WebSocketDeviceConfiguration(endpoint: "wss://192.168.1.115:12345/remote_pay",
        remoteApplicationID: "com.yourcompany.pos.app:4.3.5",
        posName: "RegisterApp", posSerial: "ABC-123",
        pairingAuthToken: savedAuthToken, pairingDeviceConfiguration: self)

    cc = CloverConnectorFactory.createICloverConnector(config)
    cc?.addCloverConnectorListener(self)
    cc?.initializeConnection()
}

func doSale() {
    // if onDeviceReady has been called
    let saleRequest = SaleRequest(amount: 1743, externalId: "bc54de43f3")
    // configure other properties of SaleRequest
    cc?.sale(saleRequest)
}

// store the token to be loaded later by loadAuthToken
func saveAuthToken(token:String) {}
func loadAuthToken() -> String? { return nil }


// PairingDeviceConfiguration
func onPairingCode(pairingCode: String) {
    // display pairingCode to user, to be entered on the Clover Mini
}

func onPairingSuccess(authToken: String) {
    // pairing is successful
    // save this authToken to pass in to the config for future connections
    // so pairing will happen automatically
    saveAuthToken(authToken)
}


// DefaultCloverConnectorListener

// called when device is disconnected
override func onDeviceDisconnected() {}

// called when device is connected, but not ready for requests
override func onDeviceConnected() {}

// called when device is ready to take requests. Note: May be called more than once
override func onDeviceReady(info:MerchantInfo){}

// required if Mini wants the POS to verify a signature
override func onVerifySignatureRequest(signatureVerifyRequest: VerifySignatureRequest) {
    //present signature to user, then
    // acceptSignature(...) or rejectSignature(...)
}

// required if Mini wants the POS to verify a payment
override func onConfirmPaymentRequest(request: ConfirmPaymentRequest) {
    //present 1 or more challenges to user, then
    cc?.acceptPayment(request.payment!)
    // or
    // cc?.rejectPayment(...)
}

// override other callback methods
override func onSaleResponse(response:SaleResponse) {
    if response.success {
        // sale successful and payment is in the response (response.payment)
    } else {
        // sale failed or was canceled
    }
}

override func onAuthResponse(response:AuthResponse) {}
override func onPreAuthResponse(response:PreAuthResponse) {}

// will provide UI information about the activity on the Mini,
// and may provide input options for the POS to select some
// options on behalf of the customer
override func onDeviceActivityStart(deviceEvent:CloverDeviceEvent){} // see CloverConnectorListener.swift for example of calling invokeInputOption from this callback
override func onDeviceActivityEnd(deviceEvent:CloverDeviceEvent){}
// etc.
}

```
